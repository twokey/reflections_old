Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than 
keeping all your work local?

Answer:Using remote repository makes sense in two cases. It can help 
your work safe in case your local computer breakes and local repository 
will be not accessible. Another usefull scenario when you collaborate
with someone else you can work on the same project simultaneously.
In addition to that, you mith want to use GitHub when you work on 
the same project from different locations.
