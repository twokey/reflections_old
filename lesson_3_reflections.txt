Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than 
keeping all your work local?

Answer:Using remote repository makes sense in two cases. It can help 
your work safe in case your local computer breakes and local repository 
will be not accessible. Another usefull scenario when you collaborate
with someone else you can work on the same project simultaneously.
In addition to that, you mith want to use GitHub when you work on 
the same project from different locations.

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

Answer: Because You have more control over what you are doing. There
is a chance that someone upload changes to the repository and you are
not awer of them.

Question: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Answer: Forks are just copies of others people repositories on GitHub.
It is useful when I want to work on someones project, but I don't have
permissions to edit (push) to their repository.
